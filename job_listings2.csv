   About Intuitive Machines
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  Intuitive Machines is an innovative and cutting-edge space company making cislunar space accessible to both public and private customers. Our mission is to further science and exploration, communications, and economic progress from the Earth to the Moon and beyond. With the first commercial lunar landing in history, multiple NASA lunar missions in development, and additional private missions on our manifest, we pride ourselves in supporting our customers and the nation in paving the way to return humans to the surface of the Moon. Our world-class team includes experts in all aspects of spacecraft subsystems design, development and test, on-orbit operations, and safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   About The Role
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  In June 2009, NASA launched the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), a robotic spacecraft now orbiting the Moon at 100-km altitude. The LRO primary objective is enable fundamental scientific discoveries about the Moon. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) is one of seven instruments onboard LRO. LROC comprises three cameras that capture high-resolution black-and-white images and moderate-resolution multispectral images of the lunar surface.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January of 2023, ShadowCam, a NASA-funded instrument hosted onboard the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (KPLO , began orbital operations. By collecting high-resolution images of permanently shadowed regions (PSRs), ShadowCam provides critical information about the distribution and accessibility of water, ice, and other volatiles at spatial scales (1.7 m/pixel) required to mitigate risks and maximize the results of future exploration activities.
