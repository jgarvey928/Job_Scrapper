   The Company
   <br/>
  </strong>
  PayPal has been revolutionizing commerce globally for more than 25 years. Creating innovative experiences that make moving money, selling, and shopping simple, personalized, and secure, PayPal empowers consumers and businesses in approximately 200 markets to join and thrive in the global economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We operate a global, two-sided network at scale that connects hundreds of millions of merchants and consumers. We help merchants and consumers connect, transact, and complete payments, whether they are online or in person. PayPal is more than a connection to third-party payment networks. We provide proprietary payment solutions accepted by merchants that enable the completion of payments on our platform on behalf of our customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We offer our customers the flexibility to use their accounts to purchase and receive payments for goods and services, as well as the ability to transfer and withdraw funds. We enable consumers to exchange funds more safely with merchants using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal or Venmo account balance, PayPal and Venmo branded credit products, a credit card, a debit card, certain cryptocurrencies, or other stored value products such as gift cards, and eligible credit card rewards. Our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end-to-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant access to funds and payouts. We also help merchants connect with their customers, process exchanges and returns, and manage risk. We enable consumers to engage in cross-border shopping and merchants to extend their global reach while reducing the complexity and friction involved in enabling cross-border trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Our beliefs are the foundation for how we conduct business every day. We live each day guided by our core values of Inclusion, Innovation, Collaboration, and Wellness. Together, our values ensure that we work together as one global team with our customers at the center of everything we do – and they push us to ensure we take care of ourselves, each other, and our communities.

  Since 2010 SynergisticIT has helped Jobseekers get employed in the tech Job market by providing candidates the requisite skills, experience and technical competence to outperform at interviews and at clients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tech Job market has been affected by massive layoffs and since 2021 there have been more than 600,000.00 tech layoffs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   Good news is that the Fed Reserve has cut interest rates which should boost tech hiring however tech companies will still only hire the best candidates and would not over hire. Also there are a large number of laid off techies who would want to get hired first. To ensure candidates get hired they need to be better than the other Jobseekers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  The Job market is Hyper Competitive. For 1 position 500-1000 candidates or more are applying and laid off job seekers are also competing for entry level Job positions.
  <br/>

  <strong>
   SYNERGISTICIT is aware that the Job Market is Challenging due to almost 600,000 Tech Layoffs within the past 2 years due to which The Job market is flooded with thousands of laid off Techies who are competing with existing Jobseekers. For entry level Job seekers to get client interviews and jobs they need to differentiate themselves by ensuring they have exceptional skills and technologies to be noticed by clients.
   <br/>
   <br/>

  We are matchmakers we provide clients with candidates who can perform from day 1 of starting work. In this economy no client wants or has the resources to take an entry level person and spend resources on upgrading their skills and on top of that pay the jobseeker. That's the specific reason there are so many techies both experience and freshers who are unemployed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clients have now the option to hire remote workers from anywhere so for a Jobseeker its important to introspect and see how they can become better and have the skills and technologies to meet client requirements.

  Since 2010 SynergisticIT has helped Jobseekers get employed in the tech Job market by providing candidates the requisite skills, experience and technical competence to outperform at interviews and at clients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tech Job market has been affected by massive layoffs and since 2021 there have been more than 600,000.00 tech layoffs.
  <br/>

  <strong>
   Good news is that the Fed Reserve has cut interest rates which should boost tech hiring however tech companies will still only hire the best candidates and would not over hire. Also there are a large number of laid off techies who would want to get hired first. To ensure candidates get hired they need to be better than the other Jobseekers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  The Job market is Hyper Competitive. For 1 position 500-1000 candidates or more are applying and laid off job seekers are also competing for entry level Job positions.

  SYNERGISTICIT is aware that the Job Market is Challenging due to almost 300,000 Tech Layoffs within the past year due to which The Job market is flooded with thousands of laid off Techies who are competing with existing Jobseekers. For entry level Job seekers to get client interviews and jobs they need to differentiate themselves by ensuring they have exceptional skills and technologies to be noticed by clients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since 2010 we have helped Jobseekers differentiate themselves by providing the clients with candidates who have the requisite skills and experience to outperform at interviews and clients. Here at SynergisticIT We just don't focus on getting you a Job we make careers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All Positions are open for all visas and US citizens
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We are matchmakers we provide clients with candidates who can perform from day 1 of starting work. In this economy no client wants or has the resources to take an entry level person and spend resources on upgrading their skills and on top of that pay the jobseeker. That's the specific reason there are so many techies both experience and freshers who are unemployed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clients have now the option to hire remote workers from anywhere so for a Jobseeker its important to introspect and see how they can become better and have the skills and technologies to meet client requirements.

  <strong>
   The Company
   <br/>
  </strong>
  PayPal has been revolutionizing commerce globally for more than 25 years. Creating innovative experiences that make moving money, selling, and shopping simple, personalized, and secure, PayPal empowers consumers and businesses in approximately 200 markets to join and thrive in the global economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We operate a global, two-sided network at scale that connects hundreds of millions of merchants and consumers. We help merchants and consumers connect, transact, and complete payments, whether they are online or in person. PayPal is more than a connection to third-party payment networks. We provide proprietary payment solutions accepted by merchants that enable the completion of payments on our platform on behalf of our customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We offer our customers the flexibility to use their accounts to purchase and receive payments for goods and services, as well as the ability to transfer and withdraw funds. We enable consumers to exchange funds more safely with merchants using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal or Venmo account balance, PayPal and Venmo branded credit products, a credit card, a debit card, certain cryptocurrencies, or other stored value products such as gift cards, and eligible credit card rewards. Our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end-to-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant access to funds and payouts. We also help merchants connect with their customers, process exchanges and returns, and manage risk. We enable consumers to engage in cross-border shopping and merchants to extend their global reach while reducing the complexity and friction involved in enabling cross-border trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Our beliefs are the foundation for how we conduct business every day. We live each day guided by our core values of Inclusion, Innovation, Collaboration, and Wellness. Together, our values ensure that we work together as one global team with our customers at the center of everything we do – and they push us to ensure we take care of ourselves, each other, and our communities.
