   Code that saves lives.
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  As a software developer at Epic, you’ll write software that impacts the lives of 75% of Americans and 300 million patients around the world. Working in your own office, surrounded by thousands of high-caliber developers, you’ll use modern development methodologies and employ user-centered design, analytics, and machine learning tools to drive innovation in healthcare. Using leading-edge technologies and languages like JS, TS, and C#, you’ll invent better ways to reduce medical errors, streamline record sharing between hospitals, and provide the quality of care a patient deserves. Learn more about our team at https://careers.epic.com/jobs/softwaredevelopment/.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   Write software for the most innovative health systems on the planet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  The top-ranked health systems in U.S. News and World Report are Epic customers.

All meals are restaurant-quality but cost only a few dollars, and they’re prepared by a team comprised of kitchen talent from restaurants around the country. And, after five years here, you’ll earn a four-week sabbatical anywhere in the world.
