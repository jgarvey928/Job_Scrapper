  Synonym enables the commercialization and manufacture of bioproducts—accelerating the world’s transition to better, more sustainable materials and products. We believe that products created using biology will represent the next manufacturing revolution, transforming crucial elements of supply chains across multiple sectors and helping to catalyze a sustainable and decarbonized future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Synonym works as the strategic biomanufacturing partner for companies building these next-generation bioproducts. We help companies chart their roadmaps toward commercialization and profitability by building custom techno-economic analyses (TEA) and carbon emissions estimates. We match companies with contract manufacturers (CMOs) to help companies secure capacity and meet production needs. And we undertake large capital projects, working with companies to develop, finance, construct, and operate dedicated, modular fermentation facilities so they can produce at scale.
  <br/>

   Pittsburgh Candidate Highly Preferred
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  Software Engineering I, Productivity Engineering
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   About The Team
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  Productivity Engineering team members at TeleTracking are the engineer's engineers. We aim to simplify and amplify the ability for developers to build, deploy, release, and observe their changes in production. By creating software development experiences that provide abstractions around common scenarios, we pave the way for developers to focus on their core business domains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We practice an observability-first and product-minded approach to the services that we develop and operate. To do this, we work backwards from customer value and ease of use, to planning the metrics that will help us differentiate what is working from what isn't before writing a line of code. We validate the effectiveness of our offerings by applying them in production to internally and externally facing services that we own.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   About The Role
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  As a software engineer, you will have autonomy to architect, build and operate components of the delivery and observability platforms that are critical to TeleTracking's needs. You will collaborate with a customer base to explore how they build and deploy changes to uncover the friction that slows them down from deploying to production. With an end-to-end understanding, you will build a developer experience that leverages your findings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An example of a developer experience that Productivity Engineering team members build is designing an interface, iterating over it until they are satisfied that it is easy to use and implementing its backend services. The backend services are instrumented with metrics that help the team gain insights on usage and improvements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You will grow, learn, and be challenged by working across many technology stacks that go across build and deployment systems, to cloud infrastructure and microservices, and to security and observability tooling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   What will you learn?
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>

  At swivl, we believe that exceptional customer experiences shouldn't be a luxury reserved for large corporations with vast resources. In the self-storage industry, operators—whether overseeing a single facility or a thousand—often grapple with the challenges of meeting rising customer expectations with limited tools and personnel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's why swivl exists. Our mission is to empower self-storage operators to overcome these hurdles through contextual and action-driven conversations that simplify and enhance customer engagement. We’ve built the industry’s first fully integrated conversational AI platform that offers operators the ability to power things like digital assistants, online self-service automation, website inventory recommendations, call center deflection, and omnichannel experiences–all in one solution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Today, we partner with over 4,000 facilities daily, including industry leaders like Copper Safe Storage, Storage Max, Prime Storage, and StorageMart. Together, we're redefining what's possible in customer engagement for the self-storage industry.

    You are able to work cross-functionally with designers and product folks at just the right level—whether it’s big-picture brainstorming or in nitty-gritty details.
   </li>
   <li>
    You thrive on collaboration and know how to create space for everyone’s voice at the table (or Zoom call).

    You believe in the magic of iteration—shipping small, learning fast, and improving constantly.

   <li>
    You genuinely enjoy mentoring and helping your teammates level up—it’s not just about writing code, but building the people around you up too.

    You're a pro at striking the perfect balance between driving things forward on your own to deliver real value while also breaking down problems into bite-sized pieces that the whole team can tackle together.

  💻 Types of projects you’ll work on
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We’re all about making life easier for our customers—whether it’s simplifying how they create and maintain their docs or giving them better ways to track API metrics. Solving real problems for our users means we get to tackle some seriously interesting technical challenges. Some examples of projects Back End Engineers have worked on recently include:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    We built a Git-backed data storage service to scale with our growing customer base, serving thousands of projects seamlessly via Git storage. But it wasn’t just a cool engineering feat—it empowers our users to manage their docs directly from their existing Git repositories. People say documentation is where information goes to die, but we’re on a mission to make ReadMe the place where documentation truly comes to life!
   </li>
   <li>
    Some projects are about looking back so we can build a better future. To keep ReadMe moving forward, we took a hard look at our original API layer and realized it needed a redesign—not just for our sake, but to make our customers' lives easier too. So, we rolled up our sleeves, reworked our API models, separated our APIs from our data layer, and automated API documentation. It’s easy for companies to just keep stacking onto what already exists, but at ReadMe, we believe quality improvements matter just as much as new features.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    If we think we might be a good fit for you, we’ll set up a 30 minute phone chat with one of our Engineering Managers. They'll tell you more about the role, and get a chance to learn more about your personal experience.

   <li>
    Next, a 30-minute phone interview with Laura, our VP of Engineering, where we’ll dive a bit more into your background.

    We’ll then do a technical assessment with a couple of ReadMe’s engineers.
   </li>
   <li>
    Finally, we’ll invite you to an ""onsite"" interview conducted over Zoom! These take an average of 4.5 hours including an hour break. We are able to be flexible with the schedule and split it up over two days if that works best for you! We start with a 15-minute get-to-know-you with the people you’ll be interviewing with, and then have you talk with each person one-on-one later on.

","This role is remote, so it can be executed globally. However, to facilitate working with the engineering team we strongly prefer candidates on the East Coast (US) or in Europe (NY/London/Warsaw/Berlin).
About ElevenLabs
At ElevenLabs, we are pioneering voice technology with our cutting-edge research and products.
We launched in January 2023 and have since reached over 1 million users globally and have partnered with the world’s biggest names (see customer stories). We closed our Series-C funding at a 3.3B valuation at the beginning of this year and are backed by the leading names in tech and AI (a16z, ICONIQ, NEA, Sequoia, NFDG, Salesforce, and many others).
We are at an exciting phase of our growth and innovation and are looking for ambitious people to help us further push the boundaries of voice AI. This is a rare chance to be an early member of a company on the rise. If this excites you, we want to meet you!
Who We Are
A global team of passionate and innovative individuals united by curiosity and a shared goal: to be the first choice for AI audio solutions. Together, we are shaping a new technology and market from the ground up. We innovate quickly and take pride in getting things right, from the big picture initiatives to the details that keep us moving smoothly every day. We work with high autonomy and accountability where the best idea wins at any time and from anyone.
About The Role
We are looking for Full-Stack engineers to develop and maintain both front-end and back-end components of our product suite.
Your General Responsibilities Will Include
Building and maintaining the front-ends for our platform and products, which are built on top of our cutting-edge voice models and used by millions of users.
High degrees of ownership. You will be responsible for shipping end-to-end features across the front and back ends of our stack, as well as helping set the direction of the features and products you're working on.
Collaborating closely with others on the Engineering, Growth and Sales teams to understand, and design solutions for, our customer and internal team’s most important problems and workflows.
We believe in pairing engineers with work that matches their strengths and interests. This means that there is significant flexibility in staffing engineers across the company.
Specific Responsibilities Might Include
Improving our existing products to ensure that they’re intuitive, powerful and make innovative use of our research team’s latest break-throughs. This could involve making sweeping UX changes, adding significant functionality, or building integrations with other common consumer/enterprise solutions.
Designing & developing clean, intuitive, and functional user interfaces for products that will be used by millions of users and the world’s largest enterprises.
Working with internal teams and customers directly to synthesize feedback, understand user’s issues, and then design improvements and features to solve them.
Who You Are
We're looking for exceptional individuals who combine technical excellence with ethical awareness, who are excited by hard problems and motivated by human impact. You’ll strive with us if you:
Are passionate about audio AI driven by a desire to make content universally accessible and breaking the frontiers of new tech.
Are a highly motivated and driven individual with a strong work ethic. Our team is aware of this critical moment of audio AI evolution and is committed to going the extra mile to lead.
Are analytical, efficient, and strive on solving complex challenges with a first principles mindset.
Consistently strive for excellence, delivering high-quality work quickly and exceeding expectations.
