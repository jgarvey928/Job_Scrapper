   </li>
   <li>
    Data Collection – You will be expected to develop a deep understanding of the core applications we leverage to collect data.

Position Overview
Do you have a passion for analyzing data and using it to solve problems? At Kiewit, we believe in the power of analytics to create exceptional results. Kiewit's Southwest District Business Development team is seeking a Data Analyst to support the Municipal Water Market for West Coast Infrastructure. We are looking for someone with a passion for performing data analysis, data mining, and eventually data science in a professional setting.

District Overview
Kiewit Southwest District specializes in heavy civil, transportation, water/wastewater and power projects, and we typically self-perform most of the work. We self-perform work such as mass grading, drainage, PCCP paving, utilities and more.
We are looking for people committed to the construction industry with safety, quality, costs and schedule in mind. This district includes projects in Arizona, Nevada, Utah. On our team, you’ll have the opportunity to see more, touch more, and do more than you ever imagined. Working hard will not only bring you satisfaction from a job well done, but it will help propel your career forward faster than you might expect.

Location
This position is located in Phoenix, AZ with remote abilities.
Responsibilities
Best-in-class solutions – Your primary role will be delivering analytical solutions to the business. You will need to bring a strong business acumen and work to understand the business challenges facing your stakeholders. From there, you will need to leverage your technical skills and deep knowledge of data to recommend and build solutions for these stakeholders.
Data Modeling – You will have access to many data sources to provide solutions to your stakeholders. But often this data may not be modeled or structured in an optimal manner to meet your needs. We will have resources to offer support, but ultimately you will be expected to be highly self-sufficient and have the technical skills (SQL) to restructure this data as needed.
Data Visualization – Your output will embody data visualization best practices. Our team is committed to building high quality, performant, insightful solutions that meet specific business needs. The solutions you produce will meet our quality and performance standards.
Data Analysis – You will be expected to, with limited direction, leverage data to make strategic recommendations to the business. This may include formulating and testing hypotheses, performing correlation analysis, and other forms of data mining. You will also be expected to understand and articulate the business impact of any recommendations.
Communication and Presentation – On the front end, you will be expected to guide requirement gathering conversations with stakeholders, asking insightful questions to see the business from their perspective. On the back end of solution development/analysis, you will be expected to explain results of analysis to team members, train stakeholders on how to use decision support tools, and succinctly convey how solutions meet specific business needs.
Data Collection – You will be expected to develop a deep understanding of the core applications we leverage to collect data. You will work with stakeholders and key members of our product team to understand which data we capture today, as well as participate in the development/procurement of future solutions to help capture other necessary data we may not be currently collecting.

You will be expected to embrace this mission and work closely with your team members to advance our analytical capabilities.
