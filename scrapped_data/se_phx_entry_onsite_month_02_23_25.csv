   Be a Part of the WOS Team!
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  Working for WOS is more than a job, it’s the start of a new career, a unique opportunity to develop your skills through training and individual mentorship. Founded in 2005, Workforce Opportunity Services (WOS) is a leading nonprofit organization committed to developing the skills of untapped talent from historically underrepresented communities through partnerships with organizations dedicated to diversifying their workforce. This includes people of color, first-generation college graduates, veterans, and early-career aspirants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   Overview
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  This job is a member of the Information Technology Team within the Information Technology Division. Responsible for leveraging cutting edge technology to solve business problems at American Airlines by participating in all phases of the development process from inception through transition, advocating the agile process and test-driven development, using object-oriented development tools to analyze, model, design, construct and test reusable objects, and making the codebase a better place to live and work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American Airlines is a commercial airline providing passenger and cargo transportation throughout North America, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, Europe, and Asia. The following describes the essential job functions, job qualifications, and other requirements of the job. While not an exhaustive description, it is intended to accurately reflect the current job. Management will modify the job or require other tasks be performed whenever it deems it appropriate to do so, observing, of course, any legal obligations including any collective bargaining obligations. Management will consider providing reasonable accommodations as necessary to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other applicable federal, state or local laws. Reasonable accommodations that facilitate successful performance of all essential job functions will not impact an individual’s paygrade or level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This list is intended to accurately reflect the current job but there may be additional essential (and certainly non-essential job functions) that are not referenced.
