ReadMe

1**************************************************

At ReadMe, we’re committed to cultivating a diverse and inclusive workplace. We welcome people of all backgrounds, experiences, abilities, and perspectives. We are an equal opportunity employer and a pleasant and supportive place to work. We'd love to have you come join us here!
You're fluent in TypeScript and have a deep understanding of cloud computing services, making you a go-to for building and scaling modern systems.
When it comes to architecture, your skills are top-notch—you're a pro at designing systems that are robust, scalable, maintainable and future-proof.
You are able to work cross-functionally with designers and product folks at just the right level—whether it’s big-picture brainstorming or in nitty-gritty details.
You thrive on collaboration and know how to create space for everyone’s voice at the table (or Zoom call).
Complex problems don’t scare you: you’re a natural at untangling them, finding efficient solutions, and guiding the team toward the finish line—even if it means making a compromise or two along the way.
You believe in the magic of iteration—shipping small, learning fast, and improving constantly.
You genuinely enjoy mentoring and helping your teammates level up—it’s not just about writing code, but building the people around you up too.
You're a pro at striking the perfect balance between driving things forward on your own to deliver real value while also breaking down problems into bite-sized pieces that the whole team can tackle together.
You're passionate about engineering and always hungry to learn more, with a knack for diving deep to understand the scope of a problem and crafting the right solutions.
We built a Git-backed data storage service to scale with our growing customer base, serving thousands of projects seamlessly via Git storage. But it wasn’t just a cool engineering feat—it empowers our users to manage their docs directly from their existing Git repositories. People say documentation is where information goes to die, but we’re on a mission to make ReadMe the place where documentation truly comes to life!
Some projects are about looking back so we can build a better future. To keep ReadMe moving forward, we took a hard look at our original API layer and realized it needed a redesign—not just for our sake, but to make our customers' lives easier too. So, we rolled up our sleeves, reworked our API models, separated our APIs from our data layer, and automated API documentation. It’s easy for companies to just keep stacking onto what already exists, but at ReadMe, we believe quality improvements matter just as much as new features.
Unlimited PTO with a three-week minimum. 🏝
Fully covered medical, dental, and vision insurance for you, and your dependents. 🩺
A One Medical membership. 🧑‍⚕️
A wellness stipend for therapy of up to $350 per month for up to 6 months. 😌
A wellness stipend of up to $150 per month. 🏋️
One-to-one donation matching of up to $1,000 per year. 💸
Twelve weeks of paid parental leave after the birth or adoption of a child. 🐣
Work from home office stipend of $500. 🖥️
Three offsite retreats per year to get together with coworkers and plan for the quarter ahead. ✈️
Take a look at our handbook for more information on our benefits! 📘
If we think we might be a good fit for you, we’ll set up a 30 minute phone chat with one of our Engineering Managers. They'll tell you more about the role, and get a chance to learn more about your personal experience.
Next, a 30-minute phone interview with Laura, our VP of Engineering, where we’ll dive a bit more into your background.
We’ll then do a technical assessment with a couple of ReadMe’s engineers.
Finally, we’ll invite you to an "onsite" interview conducted over Zoom! These take an average of 4.5 hours including an hour break. We are able to be flexible with the schedule and split it up over two days if that works best for you! We start with a 15-minute get-to-know-you with the people you’ll be interviewing with, and then have you talk with each person one-on-one later on.
We’ll let you know how things went within a week! If it seems like a good fit all around, we’ll extend you an offer! If not, we will update you to let you know so you aren’t left hanging.
