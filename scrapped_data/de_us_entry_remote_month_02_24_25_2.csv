  At Rinsed, we are building software to run the $15bn Car Wash industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We're a B2B SaaS company, providing car washes with all the tools they need to transition to a subscription model. Modern car washes are fully-automated tunnels that can wash over 200 cars/hr, and they are moving from selling single washes to all-you-can-wash subscriptions. We are giving this $15bn underserved market the tools to manage and grow their subscription revenue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We are a small team, who just raised our Series B from VMG Technology in addition to our Series A from Founder's Fund and Bedrock Capital. We are currently installed at over 3,000 car washes nationally helping to manage more than 8 million car wash memberships. What we've built so far is just the beginning. Get to be part of the founding DNA of building a great product, a great culture, and a great company!

  The Job Market is Challenging due to more than 150,000 Tech Layoffs in 2022 and in 2023 more than 240,000 layoffs so almost 3,90,00 tech employees have been laid off since 2022 and its still going on. The effect of this has led hundreds of thousands of laid off Tech employees competing with existing Jobseekers. Entry level Job seekers struggle to get responses to their applications, are getting ghosted after interviews. In such a scenario the Job seekers need to differentiate themselves by ensuring to obtain exceptional skills and technologies to be hired by clients as its an employer's market presently and they have a lot of hiring choices.
