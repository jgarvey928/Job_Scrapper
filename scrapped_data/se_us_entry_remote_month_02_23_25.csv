   Notice To Prospective HackerRank Job Applicants

  Synonym enables the commercialization and manufacture of bioproducts—accelerating the world’s transition to better, more sustainable materials and products. We believe that products created using biology will represent the next manufacturing revolution, transforming crucial elements of supply chains across multiple sectors and helping to catalyze a sustainable and decarbonized future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Synonym works as the strategic biomanufacturing partner for companies building these next-generation bioproducts. We help companies chart their roadmaps toward commercialization and profitability by building custom techno-economic analyses (TEA) and carbon emissions estimates. We match companies with contract manufacturers (CMOs) to help companies secure capacity and meet production needs. And we undertake large capital projects, working with companies to develop, finance, construct, and operate dedicated, modular fermentation facilities so they can produce at scale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you want to tackle global challenges that will help support a more sustainable future and be part of a team that will be an integral part of the emerging biomanufacturing ecosystem, we'd love to hear from you!

  <strong>
   About Us
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  Common Room is the customer intelligence platform that captures every buying signal, giving companies superpowers with AI enrichment and automation to reach the right person with the right context at the right time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite an explosion of buyer signals, companies are left struggling with siloed point solution vendors, bloated tech stacks, and unactionable ""intent"" data. Common Room brings together all the buying signals you care about in one place so you can track the entire customer journey, match signals to real people and accounts, take action and automate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We’ve raised over $50 million from top-tier investors including Greylock, Index, and Madrona to build the world's first customer intelligence platform for modern B2B companies. And we’re backed by 25+ operators from the fastest-growing companies in the world such as Figma, Stripe, Airtable, Slack, Notion, Loom, and more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You + Common Room? You’d be joining a team that revels in asking hard questions, collaborating gladly, and making decisions quickly—a team that values simplicity, passion, trust, each other, and our customers above all.

You build delightful, pixel-perfect user experiences which are snappy, and sweat the details on performance. You build maintainable, well-componentized code that other engineers can work with.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outside of this, you also identify and participate in important company-building initiatives that a fast growing startup needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>

   </li>

 <div class=""show-more-less-html__markup show-more-less-html__markup--clamp-after-5 relative overflow-hidden"">
  <strong>
   Pittsburgh Candidate Highly Preferred
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  Software Engineering I, Productivity Engineering
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   About The Team
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  Productivity Engineering team members at TeleTracking are the engineer's engineers. We aim to simplify and amplify the ability for developers to build, deploy, release, and observe their changes in production. By creating software development experiences that provide abstractions around common scenarios, we pave the way for developers to focus on their core business domains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We practice an observability-first and product-minded approach to the services that we develop and operate. To do this, we work backwards from customer value and ease of use, to planning the metrics that will help us differentiate what is working from what isn't before writing a line of code. We validate the effectiveness of our offerings by applying them in production to internally and externally facing services that we own.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   About The Role
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  As a software engineer, you will have autonomy to architect, build and operate components of the delivery and observability platforms that are critical to TeleTracking's needs. You will collaborate with a customer base to explore how they build and deploy changes to uncover the friction that slows them down from deploying to production. With an end-to-end understanding, you will build a developer experience that leverages your findings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An example of a developer experience that Productivity Engineering team members build is designing an interface, iterating over it until they are satisfied that it is easy to use and implementing its backend services. The backend services are instrumented with metrics that help the team gain insights on usage and improvements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You will grow, learn, and be challenged by working across many technology stacks that go across build and deployment systems, to cloud infrastructure and microservices, and to security and observability tooling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   What will you learn?
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Building and operating resilient services that are observable with key metrics and visualize them in Grafana dashboards
   </li>
   <li>
    Leveraging AWS services such as Lambda, EKS, S3, EC2, RDS
   </li>
   <li>
    Designing and writing HTTP and RESTful APIs
   </li>
   <li>
    Designing reusable deployment pipelines in Spinnaker using kustomize and pipeline templates
   </li>
   <li>
    Applying large-scale changes across 100s of source code repositories
   </li>
   <li>
    Helping other engineers to build software better, faster and safely
   </li>
   <li>
    Researching, evaluating, implementing and operating extensions to delivery and observability platforms
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </li>
  </ul>

   <li>
    Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or a related technical field involving software engineering, or equivalent practical experience

   SYNERGISTICIT is aware that the Job Market is Challenging due to almost 600,000 Tech Layoffs within the past 2 years due to which The Job market is flooded with thousands of laid off Techies who are competing with existing Jobseekers. For entry level Job seekers to get client interviews and jobs they need to differentiate themselves by ensuring they have exceptional skills and technologies to be noticed by clients.

  We are matchmakers we provide clients with candidates who can perform from day 1 of starting work.

  That's why swivl exists. Our mission is to empower self-storage operators to overcome these hurdles through contextual and action-driven conversations that simplify and enhance customer engagement. We’ve built the industry’s first fully integrated conversational AI platform that offers operators the ability to power things like digital assistants, online self-service automation, website inventory recommendations, call center deflection, and omnichannel experiences–all in one solution.
  <br/>
  <br/>

  <strong>
   About Us
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  Common Room is the customer intelligence platform that captures every buying signal, giving companies superpowers with AI enrichment and automation to reach the right person with the right context at the right time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite an explosion of buyer signals, companies are left struggling with siloed point solution vendors, bloated tech stacks, and unactionable ""intent"" data. Common Room brings together all the buying signals you care about in one place so you can track the entire customer journey, match signals to real people and accounts, take action and automate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We’ve raised over $50 million from top-tier investors including Greylock, Index, and Madrona to build the world's first customer intelligence platform for modern B2B companies. And we’re backed by 25+ operators from the fastest-growing companies in the world such as Figma, Stripe, Airtable, Slack, Notion, Loom, and more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You + Common Room? You’d be joining a team that revels in asking hard questions, collaborating gladly, and making decisions quickly—a team that values simplicity, passion, trust, each other, and our customers above all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So hello! Please, knock on our door. We'd love to meet you.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   Why we need you:
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  Your ability to quickly learn about the product, business and technology are your superpowers. You’re crave growth and learning, but are able to independently own and execute features. You build APIs that other engineers can use to solve customer problems in our product, and also focus on ensuring that our systems are efficient, scalable and reliable. You strive to ensure that Common Room’s core internal capabilities, infrastructure, and systems continue to serve the needs of our customers and our team, often staying one step ahead of the product.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outside of this, you also identify and participate in important company-building initiatives that a fast growing startup needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>

Back End Engineer,ReadMe,2 weeks ago,"San Francisco, CA",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/back-end-engineer-at-readme-4135177687?position=39&pageNum=0&refId=Pk7NqTdyRgY%2BV8eOnOqpog%3D%3D&trackingId=pIqF9liMSqXdkh6HiUEJkA%3D%3D,"<section class=""show-more-less-html"" data-max-lines=""5"">
 <div class=""show-more-less-html__markup show-more-less-html__markup--clamp-after-5 relative overflow-hidden"">
  <strong>
   📍 Location: Remote or Hybrid (SF or NYC)
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  ReadMe is looking for a back end engineer who enjoys working in a collaborative team environment. Our teams are full of curious, creative, and committed people who love what they’re building. If that sounds like you, you’ll be right at home at ReadMe!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   🦉 Who We Are
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  We're a small team of humans (and one owl) working together to do big things, and we’re growing fast! That’s where you come in. Since we’re a startup, you’ll make a big impact on ReadMe - both in the daily responsibilities of your role and beyond.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ReadMe helps more than 5,000 leading startups and tech companies build beautiful, personalized, and interactive developer hubs. If you’ve ever visited the developer docs for Apple, Notion, or Nvidia, you’ve used ReadMe! We love what we do because it’s so much more than just documentation. We’re providing tools for teams to build a better developer experience and make their products and APIs easier to use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   ✅ You’ll thrive in this role at ReadMe if…
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  <ul>
   <li>
    You're fluent in TypeScript and have a deep understanding of cloud computing services, making you a go-to for building and scaling modern systems.
   </li>
   <li>
    When it comes to architecture, your skills are top-notch—you're a pro at designing systems that are robust, scalable, maintainable and future-proof.
   </li>
   <li>
    You are able to work cross-functionally with designers and product folks at just the right level—whether it’s big-picture brainstorming or in nitty-gritty details.
   </li>
   <li>
    You thrive on collaboration and know how to create space for everyone’s voice at the table (or Zoom call).
   </li>
   <li>
    Complex problems don’t scare you: you’re a natural at untangling them, finding efficient solutions, and guiding the team toward the finish line—even if it means making a compromise or two along the way.
   </li>
   <li>
    You believe in the magic of iteration—shipping small, learning fast, and improving constantly.
   </li>
   <li>
    You genuinely enjoy mentoring and helping your teammates level up—it’s not just about writing code, but building the people around you up too.
   </li>
   <li>
    You're a pro at striking the perfect balance between driving things forward on your own to deliver real value while also breaking down problems into bite-sized pieces that the whole team can tackle together.
   </li>
   <li>
    You're passionate about engineering and always hungry to learn more, with a knack for diving deep to understand the scope of a problem and crafting the right solutions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </li>
  </ul>
  💻 Types of projects you’ll work on
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We’re all about making life easier for our customers—whether it’s simplifying how they create and maintain their docs or giving them better ways to track API metrics. Solving real problems for our users means we get to tackle some seriously interesting technical challenges. Some examples of projects Back End Engineers have worked on recently include:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    We built a Git-backed data storage service to scale with our growing customer base, serving thousands of projects seamlessly via Git storage. But it wasn’t just a cool engineering feat—it empowers our users to manage their docs directly from their existing Git repositories. People say documentation is where information goes to die, but we’re on a mission to make ReadMe the place where documentation truly comes to life!
   </li>
   <li>
    Some projects are about looking back so we can build a better future. To keep ReadMe moving forward, we took a hard look at our original API layer and realized it needed a redesign—not just for our sake, but to make our customers' lives easier too. So, we rolled up our sleeves, reworked our API models, separated our APIs from our data layer, and automated API documentation. It’s easy for companies to just keep stacking onto what already exists, but at ReadMe, we believe quality improvements matter just as much as new features.
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>
   💙 You'll love working at ReadMe because…
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  ReadMe is a company that prides itself on caring about it’s people; customers and employees. We don’t just care about the work we do, but the people who make ReadMe what it is. Take a glance at our benefits and you’ll see that our culture of care is intentionally built into how we operate as a company.
  <br/>
  <br/>

  <ul>
   <li>

    <br/>

  <strong>
   🛣️ What’s the hiring process like?
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  At ReadMe, we want the interview process to reflect who we are: open, caring, with just a touch of whimsy. We’ve designed the process not only to embody the values that have helped us build an amazing team but also to give candidates the best opportunity to showcase their skills and let their true selves shine. After all, it’s about finding the right people to help take ReadMe even further! If you want a deeper dive into our hiring philosophy check out this blog post about our interview process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    If we think we might be a good fit for you, we’ll set up a 30 minute phone chat with one of our Engineering Managers. They'll tell you more about the role, and get a chance to learn more about your personal experience.
   </li>
   <li>
    Next, a 30-minute phone interview with Laura, our VP of Engineering, where we’ll dive a bit more into your background.
   </li>
   <li>
    We’ll then do a technical assessment with a couple of ReadMe’s engineers.
   </li>
   <li>
    Finally, we’ll invite you to an ""onsite"" interview conducted over Zoom! These take an average of 4.5 hours including an hour break. We are able to be flexible with the schedule and split it up over two days if that works best for you! We start with a 15-minute get-to-know-you with the people you’ll be interviewing with, and then have you talk with each person one-on-one later on.
   </li>
   <li>
    We’ll let you know how things went within a week! If it seems like a good fit all around, we’ll extend you an offer! If not, we will update you to let you know so you aren’t left hanging.
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>
   At ReadMe, we’re committed to cultivating a diverse and inclusive workplace. We welcome people of all backgrounds, experiences, abilities, and perspectives. We are an equal opportunity employer and a pleasant and supportive place to work. We'd love to have you come join us here!

  <strong>
   We Are
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  At RelationalAI, we are enabling the future of data-centric systems that learn, reason, and predict, built on our cloud-native relational knowledge graph management system. We are bringing together a global team of exceptional people who inspire and respect one another to achieve our mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We are intellectually curious, with problem-solving mindsets and a proven track record of delivering results. We value the ability to learn, grow, and respond to an ever-changing landscape of challenges and opportunities as much as we value past experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  RelationalAI is a remote-first company that has been operating with a distributed team since day one. We are based on six continents, support team members wherever they live, and are fluent in the tools and processes of distributed and often asynchronous work.

  <br/>
  <strong>
   Who You Are
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  In general, people who take ownership do really well on the Experience team, and at RelationalAI generally. If you are proactive, apply good judgment, and seek impact, you'll fit right in here. A team mantra is ""we make progress.""
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While you might have a formal background in engineering, you may also have grown into the role from another discipline. Technical rigor is important to the work, but kind, thoughtful communication, and seeing from other perspectives are on equal footing for this role. You're comfortable thinking through complex systems and finding pragmatic solutions. You're excited about making tools that just work when you put them in people's hands.

   <br/>
  </strong>

Together, you'll build new tools that help domain experts, developers, and data people collaborate on shared models, and work closely with users to ensure the team delivers cohesive solutions that fit real problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Key focus areas include:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Visualizations for exploring entities and relationships that are useful and even fun
   </li>
   <li>
    Interfaces that let people collaboratively build and edit shared models
   </li>
   <li>
    Version control and collaboration tools which safely enable teamwork
   </li>
   <li>
    AI agents that work with users to extend what they can do
   </li>
   <li>
    State management and API integration across a growing platform
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>
   You Must Have
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Experience building highly interactive web applications with modern frameworks (solidjs experience a plus, but not required)

   <li>
    A strong foundation in frontend development (HTML, CSS, Typescript)
   </li>
   <li>
    Experience with data visualization libraries and complex graphical interfaces
   </li>
   <li>
    A track record of shipping high-quality tools or platforms
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>
   It'll Be Nice If You Have
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Experience with 3D or graph visualizations
   </li>
   <li>

   </li>
   <li>
    Open source contributions
   </li>
   <li>
    Exposure to game design principles like procedural generation, emergent behavior, and organic learning

   About Us
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  At FreeWorld, our mission is to end generational poverty and recidivism through economic mobility. We use a tech-forward approach to get returning citizens (folks with a criminal record) into living wage jobs–at scale. We’re focused on trucking jobs at the moment, but are building a platform that will expand well beyond one industry. We’re extremely proud of our 23x social ROI, but have aspirations to 10x that. We’re also proud to have been chosen by MIT Solve as one of the most innovative tech-forward non-profits driving real change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
