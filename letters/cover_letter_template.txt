Just read these instructions and incorporate them then delete them from this letter. The section in square brackets [] and only the square brackets, I want you to fill in. Fill in the sections as instructed inside the brackets also based on the rest of the letter and the job description. Make it sound human but professional and enthusiastic. Leave the rest of the letter alone. 
DELETE EVERYTHING FROM HERE UP BUT SAVE EVERYTHING ELSE AFTER THIS SENTENCE.
[ Greet the hiring manager and state your name as well as the position you're applying for. Really try to hook the reader by showing that I have done my research on the company their needs and challenges, their goals, and what value I could bring. Express enthusiasm for the job and motivation, energy and a willingness to learn (not word for word) that will make me a strong addition to the team.  Make sure to sound enthusiastic and human but professional. Here is a great example I really like …
“I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the “position” position at “company”. As a recent honors graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering and hands-on experience in software development, distributed systems, and full-stack applications, I believe I have the skills and experiences needed to become a strong member of the “company” Team.”
Make it just like this example. Keep it short and sweet. Also remove the brackets from the text when done. And keep the rest of the letter exact the same.

My academic background in software engineering has equipped me with extensive knowledge of data structures, algorithms, software architecture principles and multiple programming paradigms. I’ve worked extensively with Java, Python, and C, applying these skills in both academic and real-world projects. In addition to high-level programming concepts like recursion, threading, and object-oriented design, I have experience with low-level programming, including memory management, bit manipulation, and register addressing, as well as some Assembly experience.

During my internship at Grey-box Technologies, I collaborated with a talented team to design and implement an Android-based mesh network prototype that enabled seamless peer-to-peer decentralized communication for over 50 connected devices, reducing operational costs by 30% while significantly extending network coverage. As part of the team, I contributed to Linux kernel development to optimize device performance, implemented network protocols to ensure reliable data transmission, and utilized concurrent programming techniques to handle real-time communication efficiently. Together, we developed a scalable full-stack software architecture, ensuring the system could handle increasing device loads while maintaining high performance and reliability. This project showcased my ability to work effectively as a team member to deliver results-driven solutions.

My technical background combines core development practices with modern DevOps tools and methodologies. I have experience implementing continuous integration/continuous deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions and Jenkins as well as streamlining development workflows and automating testing processes. My experience with Docker containerization and infrastructure as code supports rapid deployment and scaling of applications. At Grey-box Technologies, I applied Agile Scrum methodologies, participating in sprint planning, daily standups, and retrospectives while using version control through Git for collaborative development. Regular unit testing and code reviews ensured high quality, maintainable code throughout the development lifecycle. Additionally, I have strong references from both my academic mentor, Professor Ruben Acuna at Arizona State University, and my professional supervisor, Valentin Kravtchenko, CEO of Grey-box Technologies, who can speak to my technical knowledge and my ability to collaborate effectively within teams.

Thank you for considering my application. I would love the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills align with this position. Please feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience. I am excited about the prospect of contributing to your team and would love the opportunity to discuss how I can make an impact.

Sincerely,
John S. Garvey
