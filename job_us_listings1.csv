  At swivl, we believe that exceptional customer experiences shouldn't be a luxury reserved for large corporations with vast resources. In the self-storage industry, operators—whether overseeing a single facility or a thousand—often grapple with the challenges of meeting rising customer expectations with limited tools and personnel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's why swivl exists. Our mission is to empower self-storage operators to overcome these hurdles through contextual and action-driven conversations that simplify and enhance customer engagement. We’ve built the industry’s first fully integrated conversational AI platform that offers operators the ability to power things like digital assistants, online self-service automation, website inventory recommendations, call center deflection, and omnichannel experiences–all in one solution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Today, we partner with over 4,000 facilities daily, including industry leaders like Copper Safe Storage, Storage Max, Prime Storage, and StorageMart. Together, we're redefining what's possible in customer engagement for the self-storage industry.

  At FreeWorld, our mission is to end generational poverty and recidivism through economic mobility.

We’re focused on trucking jobs at the moment, but are building a platform that will expand well beyond one industry. We’re extremely proud of our 23x social ROI, but have aspirations to 10x that. We’re also proud to have been chosen by MIT Solve as one of the most innovative tech-forward non-profits driving real change.

  <strong>
   Who We Are
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  Investing in private equity or venture capital should be as easy as buying a stock on Robinhood but it isn’t. Instead of purchasing investments in a few clicks, investors fill out 200+ page forms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passthrough simplifies investor onboarding, fund closing, and compliance with workflows that guide investors through only what applies to them and once they’ve invested, we save their information to create a reusable investor profile—so the next investment is even faster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since launching in 2020, we’ve processed tens of billions of dollars and helped 50K+ investors complete documents in as short as 2 minutes. We’re making an outdated, manual process into something modern, simple, and built for scale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   The problems you’ll solve
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  At Passthrough, you’ll do more than simply coding and following directions. Since we’re an early stage startup, there’s plenty of opportunity to influence design and direction. We’re tackling complex projects without easy answers, like creating the investor passport from above. What kind of data is reusable, how do we store it, how should we present it to investors, what permissions need to exist? You need to approach the problem from at least technical, product, security, and visual perspectives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All of our employees and clients constantly generate new product ideas as a collaborative effort, allowing you to take on tasks outside of strictly engineering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You’ll develop a deep understanding of the whole product and technology stack. Each engineer has a unique role in the company. Regardless of what your experience is or where your career interests lie, we’ll cooperatively tailor a path that aligns with your goals and ours. As the company is changing quickly and you’re exploring your interests, we will adjust this trajectory frequently based on regular check-ins so your role is dynamic and evolving with us.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Technologies we use
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <ul>
   <li>
    React
   </li>
   <li>
    Django/Django REST
   </li>
   <li>
    Google Cloud Platform
   </li>
   <li>
    Python
   </li>
   <li>
    Enterprise APIs, such as Docusign and Sendgrid
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </li>
  </ul>
  The team you’ll work with
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The engineering team is currently a close-knit group of 5 that are a mix of NYC-based and remote. The team consists of former Google and Carta employees. We know how to build engineering, product, and revenue generating businesses in this space. We’re fast paced and highly collaborative. Engineers play a critical role in product decisions and work closely with the founders and all departments. We work in two-week long sprints, where we decide which projects the team should focus on and which projects we personally would like to work on. This gives us all autonomy to direct our day-to-day tasks in addition to our larger career goals.

   SYNERGISTICIT is aware that the Job Market is Challenging due to almost 600,000 Tech Layoffs within the past 2 years due to which The Job market is flooded with thousands of laid off Techies who are competing with existing Jobseekers. For entry level Job seekers to get client interviews and jobs they need to differentiate themselves by ensuring they have exceptional skills and technologies to be noticed by clients.
   <br/>

  Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) is building the developer tools to bring the world onchain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Today, onchain development is slow, risky, and painful, even for the most experienced onchain developers. Our goal is to bring a million developers onchain by creating an easy to use and trusted developer experience. We build API and SDK products for developers like wallets, paymaster, staking, stablecoins, onchain data, and more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We are a small team that moves like a startup at Coinbase, with a fast pace, strong ownership culture, and a relentless commitment to making developers happy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In this role you'd be leading engineering efforts for an experimental agentic payments protocol to unlock the next order of magnitude of economic value on the internet. A strong understanding of blockchain transactions, APIs, and a critical mind of developer experience will be critical. You would lend a hand in developing open standards, own backend APIs, and client SDKs.

   </li>
   <li>
    Developing server and client libraries that provide world class developer experience
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>
   What we look for in you:
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Experience constructing blockchain transactions using frameworks such as Viem, Web3py, allow, go-ethereum, or equivalent
   </li>
   <li>
    Experience shipping and scaling TypeScript and Go services in production
   </li>
   <li>
    2 years of industry experience as a software developer
    <br/>
    <br/>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>
   Nice to haves:
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Understanding of EVM or SVM blockchains
   </li>
   <li>
    Experience building open source libraries
   </li>
   <li>
    Familiarity with AI agents and LLMs
   </li>
   <li>
    Experience building 0 to 1
    <br/>

  <strong>
   About Us
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  Common Room is the customer intelligence platform that captures every buying signal, giving companies superpowers with AI enrichment and automation to reach the right person with the right context at the right time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite an explosion of buyer signals, companies are left struggling with siloed point solution vendors, bloated tech stacks, and unactionable ""intent"" data. Common Room brings together all the buying signals you care about in one place so you can track the entire customer journey, match signals to real people and accounts, take action and automate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We’ve raised over $50 million from top-tier investors including Greylock, Index, and Madrona to build the world's first customer intelligence platform for modern B2B companies. And we’re backed by 25+ operators from the fastest-growing companies in the world such as Figma, Stripe, Airtable, Slack, Notion, Loom, and more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You + Common Room? You’d be joining a team that revels in asking hard questions, collaborating gladly, and making decisions quickly—a team that values simplicity, passion, trust, each other, and our customers above all.

  <br/>
  So hello! Please, knock on our door. We'd love to meet you.

   Why we need you:
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  Your focus on user-facing experiences, and ability to collaborate with engineers, PMs and designers, are your superpower. You have experience with React/CSS/HTML/TypeScript, and can rapidly convert design mocks into functional code. You build delightful, pixel-perfect user experiences which are snappy, and sweat the details on performance. You build maintainable, well-componentized code that other engineers can work with.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outside of this, you also identify and participate in important company-building initiatives that a fast growing startup needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>

    You sweat the details on matching designed product specs, and think of performance, componentization, and testability as core requirements of building a great front-end experience for customers

    Bring your authentic self to work, and engage in candid + respectful feedback
   </li>
   <li>
    Build sustainably, and are capable of managing your time and priorities as best suits your needs
